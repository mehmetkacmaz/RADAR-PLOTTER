# RADAR-PLOTTER

The primary objective of this project is to analyze and visualize the contents of the 'aspirlLab_00000001.h5' file, which encompasses RADAR data, utilizing the Python programming language.

ABOUT HDF5

The Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) is a collection of file formats (HDF4, HDF5) devised to effectively store and organize vast volumes of data. Initially developed at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications, it is supported by The HDF Group, a non-profit organization dedicated to ensuring the ongoing advancement of HDF5 technologies and the sustained accessibility of data stored in HDF.

Within our HDF5 file, we encounter 475 distinct datasets (T00000000, T00000001, ..... T00000474). Each dataset contains 5400 real and 5400 imaginary data points. Notably, this file encompasses data from both channel1 and channel2 simultaneously. In our code implementation, we undertake parsing operations for both channel1 and channel2.
